// Declares student variable. If the value of the variable will change, use the let keyword.
let studentName;

// Uses assignment operator(=) to assign a value
let studentAge = 32;

// Alternatively, if the value of the variable will not change, use the const keyword.
const teacherName = "Abdul";

// To re-assign a variable, use only the variable's name  
studentName = "Tonya";
studentAge = 52;

// Variables created with the const keyword cannot be reassigned. Uncomment the following line to see the error:
// teacherName = "Melanie";

// To access a value stored in a variable, use the variable's name
console.log(studentName);

// To combine the message with a variable value use the template literal syntax
// Logs "My name is "
console.log("My name is ");

// Logs "My name is Tonya"
console.log(`My name is ${studentName}`);
console.log(`My teacher's name is ${teacherName}`)

// Traditionally, the var keyword was used to create variables, but modern javaScript has replaced it with let/const
var teacherAge = 48;
