// Primitive data types include undefined, string, number, boolean and null
// Undefined variables haven't been assigned values yet.

// A string is a series of characters and is surrounded by quotes

// A number can be either an integer or a decimal

// Booleans have two values: true or false

// Null is both a value and type.  It represents the concept of nothing. This differs from undefined, which is an unknown value. Null is known to be nothing.
const myNull = null;

// To check the type of data, use typeof followed by the name of the variable
// Logs undefined
console.log(typeof myUndefined);

// Logs number
console.log(typeof myNumberInt); 

// Logs boolean

// Logs string

// Pro-tip: JavaScript is loosely typed, so the type is tied to the value held in the variable, not the variable itself!
// Logs number
let myVariable = 33;

// myVariable is reassigned; Logs boolean
myVariable = false;
console.log(typeof myVariable);
